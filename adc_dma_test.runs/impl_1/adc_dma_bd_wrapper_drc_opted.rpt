2. REPORT DETAILS

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh1CalibAdd input adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh1CalibAdd/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh2CalibAdd input adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh2CalibAdd/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh1CalibAdd output adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh1CalibAdd/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh2CalibAdd output adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/sCh2CalibAdd/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO sADC_SDIO_0 connects to flops which have these adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/AD9648_SPI_inst/sRdDataR0
adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/AD9648_SPI_inst/sTxVector1 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#1 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/InstSyncOserdes. This can result in corrupted data. The adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/InstSyncOserdes/CLK / adc_dma_bd_i/ZmodADC1410_Controll_0/U0/InstSyncOserdes/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (adc_dma_bd_i/AXI_ZmodADC1410_0/U0/SPI_Adapter_inst/RECEIVE_FIFO/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.mem/gbm.gbmg.gbmga.ngecc.bmg/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
